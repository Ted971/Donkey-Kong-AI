# Donkey-Kong-AI
Basic recreation of the first Donkey Kong arcade game with the implementation of an evolutionary reinforcement learning (reinforcment learning, genetic algorithm) AI

## About the project

This project's main goal is my own personal growth, since I have always been fascinated by coding and very interested about AIs since it's debut I always wondered how to make one, how difficult would it be, what would be the challenges and how will I overcome them. This project will keep on being updated and improve over time. Since my goal was to learn how are AIs made especially neuronal network I decided going against using tools that would've trivialized this process such as Unity's ML-Agents toolkit although I took the time to learn what it can do and recognize how useful it is, I wanted this entire process to be my own so  that I could learn as much as possible from direct experience.  
This is also my first Unity project although I already had some basic knowledge of C# it was my first time using it in such an advanced context.
